    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>My name is Tyler! Welcome to my first website.</h2>
    <p>This website is serving as the first stepping stone in my quest to learn javascript, react, and firebase. This
        website was built after a couple hours of learning html and css.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Frontend Simplified for showing me the ropes. Now I know how to do some cool things like:</p>
    <button>Adding a button</button>
    <div class="rectangle">Making a box appear on screen</div>
    <p>And making it so that box up there is reactive to the window's size.</p>
    <p>That's not all I learned though.</p>
    <p>Take a look at these three boxes.</p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="box"><b>A</b></div>
        <div class="box"><b>B</b></div>
        <div class="box"><b>C</b></div>
    </div>
    <p>As you can see, they have multiple css stylings attached to them. They are hovering infinitely, have centered text, the background, as well as the text color, changes when you hover your mouse over them, and the boxes themselves are perfectly centered inside the completely reactive container</p>
    <p>I can do all of this, and more, for you or your company. Just simply hit the button below to take you to my contact page to get started.</p>
