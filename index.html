    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>My name is Tyler! Welcome to my first website.</h2>
    <p>This website is serving as the first stepping stone in my quest to learn javascript, react, and firebase. This
        website was built after a couple hours of learning html and css.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Frontend Simplified for showing me the ropes. Now I know how to do some cool things like:</p>
    <button>Adding a button</button>
    <div class="rectangle">Making a box appear on screen</div>
    <p>And making it so that box up there is reactive to the window's size.</p>
    <p>That's not all I learned though.</p>
    <p>Take a look at these three boxes.</p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
    </div>
</body>
